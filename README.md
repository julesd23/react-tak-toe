# React-Tak-Toe

## Description
This is a tik tak toe project used to exercise passing properties and information between components in react, as well as practice some minor styling in CSS.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Two things I would like implement in the future would first be updated interactive styling, and then another feature that would block someone from checking a box that had already been filled. The styling would just be via a CSS file. I would use drop shadows and on hover effects to give it a little bit more of a physical look. For the second I would possibly use some ternary operator logic to either allow, or not allow someone to check a certain box depending on if it was already being used. Implementing this would of course call for adding a reset (or re-render) button as well.
